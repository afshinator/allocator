You work at a port and are in charge of vessel allocations. Each day, you are given
 a list of containers that need to be shipped and a list of vessels that are leaving that day. You need to assign the
 containers to those vessels so that they can get to their final destinations.  

 Your job is to create a frontend that does a super simplified version of this.  
 Specifically, using the API documented below, you should allow the user to:
 1) View all of the containers that need to be shipped
 2) View the vessels that are leaving today
 3) Assign containers to a vessel
 4) "Save" a vessel plan by posting to the API
 5) View any vessel plans they've created
